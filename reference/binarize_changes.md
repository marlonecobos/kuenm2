# Binarize changes based on the agreement among GCMs

Highlights areas where a specified number of Global Climate Models
(GCMs) agree on a given outcome in the projected scenario. The function
can identify areas classified as suitable, unsuitable, stable-suitable,
stable-unsuitable, gained, or lost.

## Usage

``` r
binarize_changes(changes_projections, outcome = "suitable", n_gcms)
```

## Arguments

- changes_projections:

  an object of class `changes_projections`, generated by
  [`projection_changes()`](https://marlonecobos.github.io/kuenm2/reference/projection_changes.md)
  or imported using
  [`import_projections()`](https://marlonecobos.github.io/kuenm2/reference/import_projections.md),
  containing the `$Summary_changes` element.

- outcome:

  (character) The outcome to binarize. Available options are "suitable",
  "unsuitable", "stable-suitable", "stable-unsuitable", "gain" or
  "loss". Default is "suitable". See details.

- n_gcms:

  (numeric) The minimum number of GCMs that must agree on the specified
  outcome for a cell to be included in that category.

## Value

A `SpatRaster` or a list of `SpatRaster` objects (one per scenario) with
the binarized outcomes. For example, if `outcome = "suitable"` and
`n_gcms = 3`, cells with a value of 1 indicate areas where three or more
GCMs agree that the area is suitable for the species in that scenario.

## Details

The interpretation of the outcomes depends on the temporal direction of
the projection. **When projecting to future scenarios**:

- *suitable*: Areas that remain suitable (stable-suitable) or become
  suitable (gain) in the future.

- *unsuitable*: Areas that remain unsuitable (stable-unsuitable) or
  become unsuitable (loss) in the future.

- *gain*: Areas that are currently unsuitable become suitable in the
  future.

- *loss*: Areas that are currently suitable become unsuitable in the
  future.

- *stable-suitable or stable-unsuitable*: Areas that retain their
  current classification in the future, whether suitable or unsuitable.

**When projecting to past scenarios**:

- *suitable*: Areas that remain suitable (stable-suitable) or become
  unsuitable (loss) in the present.

- *unsuitable*: Areas that remain unsuitable (stable-unsuitable) or
  become suitable (gain) in the present

- *gain*: Areas that were unsuitable in the past are now suitable in the
  present.

- *loss*: Areas that were suitable in the past are now unsuitable in the
  present.

- *stable-suitable or stable-unsuitable*: Areas that retain their
  current classification in the future, whether suitable or unsuitable.

## Examples

``` r
# Step 1: Organize variables for current projection
## Import current variables (used to fit models)
var <- terra::rast(system.file("extdata", "Current_variables.tif",
                               package = "kuenm2"))

## Create a folder in a temporary directory to copy the variables
out_dir_current <- file.path(tempdir(), "Current_raw_bin")
dir.create(out_dir_current, recursive = TRUE)

## Save current variables in temporary directory
terra::writeRaster(var, file.path(out_dir_current, "Variables.tif"))


# Step 2: Organize future climate variables (example with WorldClim)
## Directory containing the downloaded future climate variables (example)
in_dir <- system.file("extdata", package = "kuenm2")

## Create a folder in a temporary directory to copy the future variables
out_dir_future <- file.path(tempdir(), "Future_raw_bin")

## Organize and rename the future climate data (structured by year and GCM)
### 'SoilType' will be appended as a static variable in each scenario
organize_future_worldclim(input_dir = in_dir, output_dir = out_dir_future,
                          name_format = "bio_", fixed_variables = var$SoilType)
