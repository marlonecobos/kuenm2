# Compute changes of suitable areas between scenarios

This function performs map algebra operations to represent how and where
suitable areas change compared to the scenario in which the model was
trained. Changes are identified as loss (contraction), gain (expansion)
and stability. If multiple climate models (GCM) are used, it calculates
the level of agreement among them for each emission scenario.

## Usage

``` r
projection_changes(model_projections, reference_id = 1, consensus = "median",
                   include_id = NULL, user_threshold = NULL, by_gcm = TRUE,
                   by_change = TRUE, general_summary = TRUE,
                   force_resample = TRUE, write_results = TRUE,
                   output_dir = NULL, overwrite = FALSE,
                   write_bin_models = FALSE, return_raster = FALSE)
```

## Arguments

- model_projections:

  a `model_projections` object generated by the
  [`project_selected()`](https://marlonecobos.github.io/kuenm2/reference/project_selected.md)
  function. This object contains the file paths to the raster projection
  results and the thresholds used for binarization of predictions.

- reference_id:

  (numeric) the reference ID for the projections corresponding to the
  current time in `model_projections`. Default is 1. See the details
  section for further information.

- consensus:

  (character) the consensus measure to use for calculating changes.
  Available options are 'mean', 'median', 'range', and 'stdev' (standard
  deviation). Default is 'median'.

- include_id:

  (numeric) a vector containing the reference IDs to include when
  computing changes. Default is `NULL`, meaning all projections will be
  included. See the details section for further information.

- user_threshold:

  (numeric) an optional threshold for binarizing the predictions.
  Default is `NULL`, meaning the function will apply the thresholds
  stored in model_projections, which were calculated earlier using the
  omission rate from
  [`calibration()`](https://marlonecobos.github.io/kuenm2/reference/calibration.md).

- by_gcm:

  (logical) whether to compute changes across GCMs. Default is TRUE.

- by_change:

  (logical) whether to compute results separately for each change,
  identifying areas of gain, loss, and stability for each GCM. Default
  is TRUE.

- general_summary:

  (logical) whether to generate a general summary, mapping how many GCMs
  project gain, loss, and stability for each scenario. Default is TRUE.

- force_resample:

  (logical) whether to force the projection rasters to have the same
  extent and resolution as the raster corresponding to the
  `reference_id`, which represents the current projections. Default is
  TRUE.

- write_results:

  (logical) whether to write the raster files containing the computed
  changes to the disk. Default is TRUE.

- output_dir:

  (character) the directory path where the resulting raster files
  containing the computed changes will be saved. Only relevant if
  `write_results = TRUE`.

- overwrite:

  (logical) whether to overwrite SpatRaster if they already exist. Only
  applicable if `write_results` is set to TRUE. Default is FALSE.

- write_bin_models:

  (logical) whether to write the binarized models for each GCM to the
  disk. Default is FALSE.

- return_raster:

  (logical) whether to return a list containing all the SpatRasters with
  the computed changes. Default is FALSE, meaning the function will
  return a NULL object. Setting this argument to TRUE while using
  multiple GCMs at a large extent and fine resolution may overload the
  RAM.

## Value

A `changes_projections` object. If return_raster = TRUE, the function
returns a list containing the SpatRasters with the computed changes. The
list includes the following elements:

- Binarized: binarized models for each GCM.

- Results_by_gcm: computed changes for each GCM.

- Results_by_change: a list where each SpatRaster represents a specific
  change.

- Summary_changes: A general summary that indicates how many GCMs
  project gain, loss, and stability for each scenario

- root_directory: the path to the directory where the results were saved
  if write_results was set to TRUE

If return_raster = FALSE, the function returns a NULL object.

## Details

When projecting a niche model to different temporal scenarios (past or
future), species’ areas can be classified into three categories relative
to the current baseline: **gain**, **loss** and **stability**. The
interpretation of these categories depends on the temporal direction of
the projection. **When projecting to future scenarios**:

- *Gain*: Areas that are currently unsuitable become suitable in the
  future.

- *Loss*: Areas that are currently suitable become unsuitable in the
  future.

- *Stability*: Areas that retain their current classification in the
  future, whether suitable or unsuitable.

**When projecting to past scenarios**:

- *Gain*: Areas that were unsuitable in the past are now suitable in the
  present.

- *Loss*: Areas that were suitable in the past are now unsuitable in the
  present.

- *Stability*: Areas that retain their past classification in the
  present, whether suitable or unsuitable.

The reference scenario (current conditions) can be accessed in the paths
element of the model_projections object (model_projections\$path). The
ID will differ from 1 only if there is more than one projection for the
current conditions.

Specific projections can be included or excluded from the analysis using
the `include_id` argument. For example, setting 'include_id = c(3, 5,
7)' will compute changes only for scenarios 3, 5, and 7. Conversely,
setting 'include_id = -c(3, 5, 7)' will exclude scenarios 3, 5, and 7
from the analysis.
