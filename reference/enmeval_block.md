# Spatial Blocks from ENMeval

A list resulting from `ENMeval::get.block()` to partition occurrence and
background localities into bins for training and validation (or,
evaluation and calibration). This object is used in the "Prepare Data
for Model Calibration" vignette to demonstrate how to implement custom
data partitions generated by `ENMeval` in `kuenm2`.

## Usage

``` r
data("enmeval_block")
```

## Format

A `list` with the following elements:

- occs.grp:

  A `numeric` vector indicating the spatial group to which each
  occurrence belongs

- bg.grp:

  A `numeric` vector indicating the spatial group to which each
  background point belongs
