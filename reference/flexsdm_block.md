# Spatial Blocks from flexsdm

A list resulting from `flexsdm::part_sblock()`, used to partition
occurrence and background localities into bins for training and
evaluation. This object is used in the "Prepare Data for Model
Calibration" vignette to demonstrate how to implement custom data
partitions generated by `flexsdm` in `kuenm2`

## Usage

``` r
data("enmeval_block")
```

## Format

A `list` with the following elements:

- part:

  A `tibble` object with information used in 'data' arguments and a
  additional column .part with partition group.

- best_part_info:

  A `tibble` with information about the best partition.
