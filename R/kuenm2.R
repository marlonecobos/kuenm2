#' kuenm2: Detailed Development of Ecological Niche Models
#'
#' kuenm2 helps to perform critical phases of the ecological niche modeling
#' process. Data preparation analyses and explorations can be done to prepare
#' data. Model calibration (model selection) can be done by creating and testing
#' several candidate models. Handy options for producing final models,
#' evaluating such models, and assessing extrapolation risks are also included.
#' Tools for post-modeling analyses are implemented to allow further
#' exploration of results.
